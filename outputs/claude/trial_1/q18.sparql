I'll work through this step-by-step.

## Step 1: Examine the ontology and extract relevant parts

Looking for compositions and recordings across all databases:

**DIAMM:**
- `diamm:Composition` - has `rdfs:label "label"`

**MusicBrainz:**
- `mb:Recording` - has `rdfs:label "label"`
- `mb:Work` - has `rdfs:label "label"` (compositions/works)

**The Session:**
- `ts:Recording` - has `rdfs:label "label"`

**Dig That Lick:**
- `dtl:Track` - has `rdfs:label "label"`

**Global Jukebox:**
- `gj:Song` - has `rdfs:label "label"`

## Step 2: Q-IDs needed

Since this query explicitly asks for finding entities based on text content ("death" in the title), I should use string matching functions like `CONTAINS()` rather than Q-IDs. This is one of the exceptions mentioned in the instructions.

## Step 3: Build the SPARQL query

I'll search across all relevant databases for compositions/recordings with "death" in their title/label using string matching.
