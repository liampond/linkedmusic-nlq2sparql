I'll analyze this query step by step.

## Step 1: Examine the Ontology for Relevant Parts

Looking at the ontology, I need to find compositions or recordings with "death" in the title. The relevant entities are:

**DIAMM:**
- `diamm:Composition` - has `rdfs:label "label"`

**MusicBrainz:**
- `mb:Recording` - has `rdfs:label "label"`
- `mb:Work` - has `rdfs:label "label"` (compositions are typically works)

**The Global Jukebox:**
- `gj:Song` - has `rdfs:label "label"`

**The Session:**
- `ts:Recording` - has `rdfs:label "label"`
- `ts:Tune` - has `rdfs:label "label"`

**Dig That Lick:**
- `dtl:Track` - has `rdfs:label "label"`

## Step 2: Q-IDs Needed

Since this query is asking for entities based on text/string content ("death" in the title), I should use string matching functions like CONTAINS() or REGEX(). No Q-IDs are needed for this query as per the instructions that allow string matching when the query explicitly requests finding entities based on text content.

## Step 3: Build the SPARQL Query

I'll search across all relevant databases for compositions/recordings with "death" in their label.
