I'll work through this step by step.

## Step 1: Examine the ontology and extract relevant parts

Looking at the ontology, I need to find entities that represent compositions or recordings:

**Compositions:**
- `diamm:Composition` - has `rdfs:label "label"`
- `mb:Work` - has `rdfs:label "label"` (works/compositions in MusicBrainz)

**Recordings:**
- `mb:Recording` - has `rdfs:label "label"`
- `ts:Recording` - has `rdfs:label "label"`
- `dtl:Track` - has `rdfs:label "label"`
- `gj:Song` - has `rdfs:label "label"`

## Step 2: Q-IDs needed

Since this query asks to find entities based on text content in the title (the word "death"), I should use string matching on the labels rather than Q-ID matching. This is explicitly allowed per the instructions for queries that request finding entities based on text/string content.

## Step 3: Build the SPARQL query

I'll search across all relevant entity types for labels containing "death":

```sparql

PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
