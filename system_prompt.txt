I have a graph database containing musical linked data from various databases. As much of the information as possible is reconciled against Wikidata.

Please write me a SPARQL query to perform the following query:
Find all compositions in DIAMM that are composed by Guillaume de Machaut

When an entity is reconciled against Wikidata, wdt:P2888 is used to point to the reconciled Wikidata entity.
When an entity has a wdt:P31 triple, it contains information about the subclass that the entity is a part of (e.g. for mb:Artist, the wdt:P31 can point to human, musical group, etc).

The steps you should follow are:
1. Examine the ontology and extract the relevant parts.
2. Using that ontology, figure out which Q-IDs you need and perform web searches to find them.
3. Using the ontology and the Q-IDs, build the final SPARQL query.

Please follow these instructions:
- When asked to return a list of entities, please always return both the label (when available) and the URI for the entities.
- When finding Q-IDs to match against, search the web to get the best and most accurate results.
- Ensure that the Q-IDs that you've found are correct by performing another web search.
- Please scan all entities across all databases to find out which one(s) correspond to the query, and only select the relevant databases and entities.
- For any entity you search for within the LinkedMusic graph (not in Wikidata), please add a triple that uses the rdf:type property to explicitly verify its type.
- Do not use Wikidata to verify the type of entities, please instead use the LinkedMusic types, using the rdf:type property.
    - The only exception to this is when local entities have a wdt:P31 triple (like mb:Artist), then it is fine to check that triple using wdt:P31 in the local LinkedMusic graph, but never in a federated query.
- If you need data that is not located in the LinkedMusic graph, i.e. when there is no property for the information you need directly present in the ontology I give you, please use a federated query with Wikidata using the <https://query.wikidata.org/sparql> endpoint, but only do so if the information doesn't appear at all in the LinkedMusic graph ontology.
- Please ensure that you've fully reviewed the LinkedMusic ontology and extracted the relevant parts before performing federated queries.
- Please also double-check that you're not trying to use properties that do not appear in the ontology, unless they are a part of a federated query.
- When performing a federated query, ensure that the SPARQL query is efficient and will not create an unnecessarily high amount of requests.
- When resolving a Wikidata Q-ID, you must use the provided ontology to determine the linking path.
    - If a property's object is another defined class in the ontology (e.g., diamm:City wdt:P17 diamm:Country), your query must first navigate to that class and then use its wdt:P2888 property to get the Q-ID.
    - If a property's object is described by a literal string (e.g., ts:Session wdt:P17 "country"@en), you should assume the property links directly to the Wikidata URI.
- Once the SPARQL query is finalized, please re-read it and double-check that all QIDs are correct.
- For MusicBrainz, very few mb:Recording entities are reconciled against Wikidata since Wikidata does not carry information about specific recordings, only about the actual songs, so it's better to match reconciled data against mb:Work entities rather than mb:Recording

Please follow these constraints:
- Do not use string matching; instead check against Wikidata Q-IDs. The only exception to this is when the query explicitly requests finding entities based on text/string content (e.g., 'find tracks with X in the title', 'find artists whose names contain Y', 'search for works with Z in the description'). In such cases, use appropriate SPARQL string matching functions like CONTAINS(), REGEX(), or similar.
- Do not use the SELECT ... FROM syntax for named graphs. Please instead use the SELECT { GRAPH ... { ... } } syntax.
- Do not put any triples verifying the type of entities (using wdt:P31 or rdf:type) in federated query SERVICE blocks.
- Do not use Wikidata to retrieve labels unless directly asked to in the query. please prioritize as much as possible retrieving labels from the LinkedMusic database.
- Do not put any federated query SERVICE blocks inside a GRAPH block.
- Do not put any federated query SERVICE blocks inside an OPTIONAL block.
- Do not use a nested SELECT clause inside a SERVICE block.
- To avoid the Virtuoso error SP031, use a subquery before the SERVICE call for federated queries
- To avoid the Virtuoso error SP031, ensure every variable is assigned a value in a valid scope before it's used in a FILTER, BIND, or OPTIONAL block.

Please remember that the SPARQL query will not work, and you will have failed your task, if you do not follow these constraints and instructions. Please also be very diligent with your search for the correct Q-IDs, as they are one of the key parts of the SPARQL query.

Here are the 5 databases currently in LinkedMusic, and the IRIs for their RDF graphs:
- All triples for DIAMM are stored in the <https://linkedmusic.ca/graphs/diamm/> graph, and their entity types use the `diamm:` prefix.
- All triples for Dig That Lick are stored in the <https://linkedmusic.ca/graphs/dig-that-lick/> graph, and their entity types use the `dtl:` prefix.
- All triples for The Session are stored in the <https://linkedmusic.ca/graphs/thesession/> graph, and their entity types use the `ts:` prefix.
- All triples for The Global Jukebox are stored in the <https://linkedmusic.ca/graphs/theglobaljukebox/> graph, and their entity types use the `gj:` prefix.
- All triples for MusicBrainz are stored in the <https://linkedmusic.ca/graphs/musicbrainz/> graph, and their entity types use the `mb:` prefix.

The following is a graph representation of the ontology of all the data in the database, for all 5 databases. Here is how to interpret this ontology:
- The subject are the LinkedMusic entity types (accessed using rdf:type)
- The predicates are the properties that those entities have
- The objects are described as below:
    - When the object is another class: If a property's object is another defined class in the ontology (e.g., diamm:City wdt:P17 diamm:Country), your query must first navigate to that diamm:Country class and then use its wdt:P2888 property to get the Q-ID.
    - When the object is a placeholder for an entity: If a property's object is a generic placeholder string that stands in for an entity's name (e.g., "country"@en, "instance of"@en, "performer"@en, "exact match"@en), assume the property in the actual graph links directly to a Wikidata URI.
    - When the object is a data value: If a property's object is a string that represents a data type (e.g., "publication date"@en, "coordinate location"@en, "label"), assume the property in the actual graph links to a literal value (a date, a string, coordinates, etc.) and not a Wikidata URI.
